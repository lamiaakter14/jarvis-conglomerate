# Images Directory

This directory contains static image assets for the JARVIS 2.0 Dashboard.

## Purpose
Store all image files used in the dashboard interface including:
- Logos and branding
- Icons and graphics
- Placeholder images
- Data visualizations
- User interface elements

## File Naming Convention
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `company-logo.png`
- Include descriptive names: `innovation-icon.svg`
- Specify dimensions when relevant: `banner-1920x400.jpg`

## Supported Formats
- PNG: For logos and graphics with transparency
- JPG: For photographs and complex images
- SVG: For scalable vector graphics and icons
- GIF: For simple animations (use sparingly)

## Optimization
All images should be optimized for web delivery:
- Compress images to reduce file size
- Use appropriate resolution (typically 2x for retina displays)
- Consider lazy loading for large images

## placeholder.png
A simple placeholder image for testing and development purposes.
Replace with actual assets during production deployment.
